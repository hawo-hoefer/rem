# Rem - a cli reminding application

This is an application inspired by [Alexey Kutepov's](https://twitch.tv/tsoding) commandline tool [tore](https://github.com/rexim/tore).

Create tasks and reminders. 
Tasks are something you may need to do.
Reminders allow you to create recurring tasks with a certain period.
